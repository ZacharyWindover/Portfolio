### AI Chatbot (Python) (PyTorch)
A project dedicated to exploring NLP, LLMs, and how different model variations affect performance and function. Currently in early development.

### Canadian Climate Summary Analysis (Python) (Pandas) (Selenium) (Matplotlib)
A console-based program that takes a sources.csv file as input, which contains the data type (ex. Historical Hydrometric Data, Hourly Climate Data, Daily Climate Records, Monthly Climate Summaries, etc) and the URLs, and will automatically download the data using selenium, compile the data using pandas, display trends in graphs using matplotlib, and train an AI model using PyTorch to identify trends and predict future climate. 

### File Sharing System (V0.2) (Java) (.io) (JavaFX)
Building upon the first variation of my file sharing application, I plan on adding numerous features such as proper accounts and login, reformatting the layout to be more user-friendly and organized, have a built-in file viewer, and add and expand other features.
