## Planned Projects

### Media Suite (Java)
Inspired by the file sharing application, I plan on making an array of programs similar to YouTube and Spotify/SoundCloud where people could upload videos, music, etc. The goal is to make a solid alternative to platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and Amazon Music, who have terrible practices, are unfair and obviously biased towards certain types of streamers, and have terrible copyright and user support.

### Office Suite
Inspired by the frustration of the high costs of professional office applications, I plan on making an array of office applications which would include a word processor, a spreadsheet application, as well as a presentation application as the first set.


### Artificial Intelligence Suite
