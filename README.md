# This is a Virtual Portfolio showcasing some of my best projects, the projects I've put the most effort into that I'm confident to showcase as the summation of my learning at Ontario Tech University 

Projects Completed In University:
- First-Person Shooter Game (C#) (Unity)
  A group project with Andrew Clegg for an Interactive Media course where we createda a rough implementation of a first-person shooter video game concept using the Unity game engine.
  
- Ray Tracing Implementation (C++) (OpenGL) (OpenMP)
  An individual project for the Advanced Graphics and Parallel Programming courses, I created and worked on a ray tracing program that took cubes and spheres with basic materials (solid colours and chromatic reflective surfaces), and rendered ppm images using ray tracing. The program had user input with command prompt, where the user would enter the image width, samples per pixel, max depth, and render type (the lighting, objects, and their positions were hard coded), and the program would return a ppm image. The program used the command line to output and update the amount of lines remaining to create the image.
